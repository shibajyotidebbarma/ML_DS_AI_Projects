This repository contains all my projects solutions for Machine Learning A to Z Course

## Data Preprocessing Project[:file_folder:](https://github.com/shibajyotidebbarma/Machine_Learning_A_to_Z/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20A-Z/Part%201%20-%20Data%20Preprocessing/Section%202%20--------------------%20Part%201%20-%20Data%20Preprocessing%20--------------------)

- Built a template in Python and R to preprocess the dataset.
- Structure different sections for future data modelling processes.

## Simple Linear Regression Project[:file_folder:](https://github.com/shibajyotidebbarma/Machine_Learning_A_to_Z/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20A-Z/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%204%20-%20Simple%20Linear%20Regression) 

- Built a Machine Learning Model to predict the Salary based upon the Years of Experience.
- Preprocess the given data to optimally predict the Job Salary in an Industrial Sector on the basis of the feature of Years of Experience.

## Multiple Linear Regression Project[:file_folder:](https://github.com/shibajyotidebbarma/Machine_Learning_A_to_Z/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20A-Z/Part%202%20-%20Regression/Section%205%20-%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression)

- Built a Machine Learning Model to predict the Profit of a StartUp based on multiple independent variables such as R & D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, State(Location).
- Implemented Backward Elimination (Step-By-Step) to build an optimal model solution to detect the most significant feature which impacts the Outcome(Profit) the most and draw valuable decision analysis to report about the dataset findings.
