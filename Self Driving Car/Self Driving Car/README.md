# Self Driving Car Project using Convolutional Neural Network and Behavioral Cloning

## Getting started

The project includes:
* Self_Driving_Car_using_Behavioural_Cloning.ipynb containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in an autonomous mode
* Data folder for data collected from the simulations
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 


##  Model Overview

* I decided to test the model provided by NVIDIA. The model architecture is described by NVIDIA [here](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf).
