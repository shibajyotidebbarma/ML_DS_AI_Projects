# Self Driving Car Project using Convolutional Neural Network and Behavioral Cloning

## Getting started

The project includes:
* Self_Driving_Car_using_Behavioural_Cloning.ipynb containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in an autonomous mode
* Data folder for data collected from the simulations runs by user
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 


Additionally download the [Udacity self-driving car simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).
Install the relevant libraries and packages. To run the code start the simulator in `autonomous mode`, open command window and type 

```
python drive.py 
```


##  Model Architecture

* The model architecture is described by NVIDIA [here](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf).
